	 * First, try to implement this using a simple linear search to find the
	 * insertion point. You will need to use compareTo. If you're not sure how
	 * it works, check the API.
	 * 
	 * Next, move on to implementing an Iterator for the list (below the add

	 * inserting into a sorted list. Think back on algorithms we've seen that

	 * one for their own methods and attributes, and another distinct namespace
	 * for their superclass's methods and attributes. You already know how to
	 * access these namespaces. Think about the special keywords you've been
	 * using in constructors.

	 * specifically, it allows use of a forEach loop:
	 * (https://docs.oracle.com/javase
	 * /8/docs/technotes/guides/language/foreach.html) This is a function which

	 * Let Eclipse to help you auto-generate the necessary methods for
	 * implementing the Iterable interface, and creating an Iterator object.
	 * Refer to the Iterator API as well.
	 * 
	 * Hint: Even though Iterator is an Interface, you can create an Iterator
	 * object AND implement its methods using an "anonymous class"
	 * 
	 * You do not have to account for a user modifying the list after the
	 * Iterator has been created. We can simply say that this results in
	 * undefined behavior (you can see in the Java API that ArrayList also does
	 * not support this behavior).
